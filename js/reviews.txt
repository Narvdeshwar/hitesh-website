***** Thank you so much for this course. You are very good at explaining thoroughly the "why' you are doing what your doing. You never assume the student understands which is a great trait. Great job and I'm looking forward to your next course! I will gladly purchase!

***** First of all I like to thank, Hitesh. This is an awesome course from scratch. It is the best course for beginners who like to start developing apps for iOS. The way he take the course is nice and I loved it. I had gone through his youtube channel and watched all his videos without bored even it is long, and I have seen some of the iOS app development channels like stanford iOS app development etc.... But I feel this is the right place to learn many keys and topics of iOS app development. This helps the beginners to become masters soon and this is my first paid course and never worthless. -- I Love iT, I Learn IT I Rate iT --and one more thing Hitesh gives you extra than what he says.

***** Offering sound, practical and realistic advice about prerequisites and additional software that will be needed. He is not promising miracles. Just a rational approach to developing simple applications using tried and true methods.

***** From you tube excerpts and the introductory information, I find Hitesh's videos informative, friendly and useful. It takes a great deal for me to part with money, particularly on the Internet - so well done Hitesh.

***** The instructor has great insight and experience working in this field. He takes the time to explain EVERYTHING in the course. Down to how to get something full screen for your labs. The instructor makes everything easy to understand and grasp. The instructor also is really quick to respond and take care of any questions/problems you may have. This course helped me advance my career.
